    "# Symca\n",
    "\n",
    "Symca is used to perform symbolic metabolic control analysis [[3,4]](references.html) on metabolic pathway models in order to dissect the control properties of these pathways in terms of the different chains of local effects (or control patterns) that make up the total control coefficient values. Symbolic/algebraic expressions are generated for each control coefficient in a pathway which can be subjected to further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generates symbolic expressions for each control coefficient of a metabolic pathway model. \n",
    "* Splits control coefficients into control patterns that indicate the contribution of different chains of local effects.\n",
    "* Control coefficient and control pattern expressions can be manipulated using standard `SymPy` functionality. \n",
    "* Values of control coefficient and control pattern values are determined automatically and updated automatically following the calculation of standard (non-symbolic) control coefficient values subsequent to a parameter alteration.\n",
    "* Analysis sessions (raw expression data) can be saved to disk for later use. \n",
    "* The effect of parameter scans on control coefficient and control patters can be generated and displayed using `ScanFig`.\n",
    "* Visualisation of control patterns by using `ModelGraph` functionality.\n",
    "* Saving/loading of `Symca` sessions.\n",
    "* Saving of control pattern results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage and feature walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing symbolic control analysis with `Symca` usually requires the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiation of a `Symca` object using a `PySCeS` model object.\n",
    "2. Generation of symbolic control coefficient expressions.\n",
    "3. Access generated control coefficient expression results via `cc_results` and the corresponding control coefficient name (see [Basic Usage](basic_usage.ipynb#syntax))\n",
    "4. Inspection of control coefficient values.\n",
    "5. Inspection of control pattern values and their contributions towards the total control coefficient values. \n",
    "6. Inspection of the effect of parameter changes (parameter scans) on the values of control coefficients and control patterns and the contribution of control patterns towards control coefficients.\n",
    "7. Session/result saving if required\n",
    "8. Further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation of a `Symca` analysis object requires `PySCeS` model object (`PysMod`) as an argument. Using the included [lin4_fb.psc](included_files.html#lin4-fb-psc) model a `Symca` session is instantiated as follows:\n"

    "\n",
    "In the case where the concentration of an internal intermediate is fixed (such as in the case of a GSDA) the `internal_fixed` argument must be set to `True` in either the `do_symca` method, or when instantiating the `Symca` object. This will typically result in the creation of a `cc_results_N` object for each separate reaction block, where `N` is a number starting at 0. Results can then be accessed via these objects as with normal free internal intermediate models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Saving and loading `Symca` sessions is very simple and works similar to `RateChar`. Saving a session takes place with the `save_session` method, whereas the `load_session` method loads the saved expressions. As with the `save_results` method and most other saving and loading functionality, if no `file_name` argument is provided, files will be saved to the default directory (see also [Basic Usage](basic_usage.ipynb#saving-and-default-directories)). As previously described, expressions can also automatically be loaded/saved by `do_symca` by using the `auto_save_load` argument which saves and loads using the default path. Models with internal fixed metabolites are handled automatically."
